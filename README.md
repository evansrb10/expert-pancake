Analysis

As expected, the weather gets warmer as the degrees latitude gets closer to the equator (0 degrees). However, the highest temperatures are not found at the equator (based on the random cities populated). The highest temperatures are found at closer to -20 degrees latitude (southern hemisphere). The lowest max temperature in the southern hemisphere at this time is at around 40(F) where as in the northern hemisphere, the temperatures reach below -40(F). There is much colder temperatures in the northern hemisphere this time of year based on the tilt of the earth.

There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness compared to the latitude. There is however, a noticeable line at the 100% humidity mark as you go all the way from one end of the latitude spectrum to the other. The same can be said for the cloudiness data. There is a noticeable line at 0 cloudiness, ~75, and 90 percent marks.

For the most part, there is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, at the equator, the wind speed doesn't get over 20mph. When you go out to -40 latitude and beyond as well as 40 and beyond latitude, there are some outliers, and higher wind speeds found. The southern hemisphere has a few cities with wind speeds around 30mph. The northern hemisphere shows some extreme outliers with a city wind speed of ~43mph and >60mph
